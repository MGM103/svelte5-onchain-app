# I built an Onchain App

## About this Repo

This repo contains the code for the series: I build an Onchain App. This series of articles delves into the development process from zero to prod for building onchain web based applications. I wrote the following [article](https://mirror.xyz/0x194541D1009d22f7aE586c3AAeF4273B5aA79596/tK4qux-P6dok6y1KG8ywoI65dlixwfZ4Tg8raPoAfRk) to explain my motivation and thought process for both building Go Fund Yourself and the subsequent articles on its development. I encourage you to check it out to better understand the purpose of this repo.

The application I built Go Fund Yourself is live and can be viewed using this [link](gofundyourself.cash). Additionally, the code for Go Fund Yourself can be viewed [here](https://github.com/MGM103/Go_Fund_Yourself).
